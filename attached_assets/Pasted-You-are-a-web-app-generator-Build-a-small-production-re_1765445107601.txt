You are a web-app generator. Build a small, production-ready multi-step UI for a menopause wellness experience. The website should let a visitor choose one or more wellness “themes” and then complete a short form that references the selected theme(s). Produce fully functional code (or a clear component-by-component implementation plan) that meets the requirements below.

1) High-level behavior
- Single-page flow with two main screens:
  1. Theme selection screen (initial): hero + language toggle + theme selector grid + Continue button.
  2. Form screen: selected theme titles shown + static Title & Description + personal fields + age group + one extra radio choice + consent checkbox + data protection notice + Back and Submit buttons.
- Theme selection screen must support selecting one or multiple themes (configurable); Continue is disabled until at least one theme is selected. Clicking Continue goes to the Form screen with the selected theme(s) pre-filled.
- Each theme has a “Read more” link that opens a modal/popup showing title, large image, and full description. Modal must be keyboard accessible and trap focus; close on Esc.
- Language toggle in the top-right switches the UI text and direction (LTR/RTL if appropriate). Persist chosen language.
- Theme selection persists across navigation (e.g., localStorage or state). Back from the form returns to theme selection and preserves previous choices.

2) Visual & structural elements
- Header (top-right): Language toggle button (icon + two-letter code). Accessible label.
- Hero (top of page): large Title and short description. Example: "Explore Your Menopause Journey" with subtitle "Select your wellness themes and discover resources tailored to you."
- Theme selector grid: 6 theme cards displayed responsively (3-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile). Each card includes:
  - thumbnail image (with alt text)
  - title
  - short description (1–2 lines)
  - a radio or checkbox control for selection (single-select or multi-select behavior should be configurable)
  - “Read more” link/button that opens the modal
  - visual selected state (outline, checkmark, aria-checked)
- Continue button centered below the grid.

3) Modal / Read more behavior
- Show full theme details: title, large image, and full description (HTML allowed).
- Focus is trapped inside modal while open; return focus to triggering element when closed.
- Close via close button, background click, or Esc.
- Modal content should be scrollable if long; include ARIA roles and accessible labeling.

4) Form screen specifics
- Static Title (non-editable): "Your Voice Matters"  
- Static Description (non-editable): "You can remain anonymous or share your contact details — it's entirely up to you. Your voice and perspective help shape better support and understanding for women navigating post-menopause wellness and graceful aging. 💗 A huge thanks for being part of this journey. Together, let's redefine what it means to age — gracefully, joyfully, and on your own terms."
- Header area showing the selected theme(s) titles (and optional small thumbnail). If multiple, list them.
- Optional Title & Description fields for reference (optional, not editable by the user).
- Personal section:
  - Name (text) — required
  - Email (email input) — required; validate format
- Age group:
  - Present 5 or 6 radio options (35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+)
  - Exactly one must be selected
- Additional choice:
  - One radio group labeled "Preferred contact method" with options Email / Phone
- Theme details summary: show chosen theme names (and small thumbnails). If multi-select, allow user to uncheck a previously selected theme (optional)
- Consent checkbox:
  - Text: “I consent to receive personalized wellness content. I have read the data protection notice.”
  - Required to enable Submit
- Data protection notice text (short paragraph) with link to full policy.
- Buttons: Back (returns to theme selection, preserving form state) and Submit.

5) Accessibility, responsiveness, and UX
- All interactive elements reachable by keyboard, with visible focus styles.
- Use semantic HTML (header, main, form, fieldset, legend, button).
- Provide aria-labels and roles for dynamic elements (modal, language toggle, theme cards).
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA.
- Responsive layout as described above.
- Graceful fallback: if JS disabled, show a progressive, usable static list and standard form submission.

6) Data handling, validation, and submission
- Validate required fields client-side and show inline error messages.
- On submit, send JSON payload to a configurable POST endpoint:
{
  title?: string,
  description?: string,
  personal: { name: string, email: string },
  ageGroup: string,
  extraChoice: string,
  themes: [{ id: string, title: string }],
  consent: true,
  language: "en"
}
- Show success confirmation on successful submission and a helpful error message on failure.
- Include CSRF/token placeholder and an example fetch call. Log payload to console in dev.
